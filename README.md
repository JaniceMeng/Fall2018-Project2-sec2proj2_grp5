# Project 2: Shiny App Development Version 2.0


In this second project of GR5243 Applied Data Science, we develop a version 2.0 of an *Exploratory Data Analysis and Visualization* shiny app on Citi Bike Data using [Citi Bike](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/NYC-BigApps/Citi-Bike-System-Data/vsnr-94wk) and [Bike Injury Data](http://www.nyc.gov/html/dot/html/about/vz_datafeeds.shtml)

The app is available here: link

Citi Bike succeeds on so many levels - environmental, health, efficiency. It also becomes a popular transpotation way for tourists who visit NYC, a fun and affordable way to get around town. There are 12,000 bikes. 750 stations. 60 neighborhoods in New York, which means people can find a bike and ride away at nearly every block and every street. However, the bike injuries is a thing. So our app will locate those high bike injury area to help people detour those routes. Furthermore, considering huge volumn NYC tourists every year, our app will plan a visiting route for tourists to visit the Empire State Building, Wall Stree or whatever places they want to go by bike.

The **Purpose of Design** for this app is 
- :strawberry:help bikers locate high injury area and avoid it:strawberry:
- :watermelon:elp tourists find the best route to visit NYC:watermelon:
- :banana:explore interesting part of Citi Bike:banana:
